# Contributing to Visage-Asr

:star::sparkles: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :star::sparkles:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to **Visage-Asr** and its packages, which are hosted on GitHub.
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request :wink:.

# Repository notes

The default branch of the repository is the **develop** branch. This assumes that every changes have to be done there.
The **master** branch will be the one that will be deployed, so we will be merging **develop** branch to it only when we have stable versions.
Those versions will be tagged and released all along the project.

# Development pattern for contributors

1. Create a personal fork of the main **visage-asr** repository in GitHub.
2. Make your changes in a named branch different from develop (the default branch), e.g. you create a branch my-awesome-feature.
3. Generate a pull request through the Web interface of GitHub.
4. There is not _yet_ any convention or general rule to follow for the coding style. Just use your best judgment and feel free to write good code depending on the languages or technologies you will be using.

## Pull request

1. Contributors can make pull resquests and merge it themselves on the develop branch.
2. Every pull request made on the master branch must be reviewed by at least one other member of the team before being merged.
